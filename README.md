# Homicides-in-America
Interactive Graphics Final Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization 

• Collaborated as team of 4 to develop an interactive, web-based dashboard application in R with Shiny as tool to visualize a Kaggle Inc. dataset of U.S. homicide reports from 1980-2014 with more than 600,000 observations and 24 variables. 

•	Devised and programmed in R with ggplot2 and Shiny interactive time series plots (25% of project’s graphics) featuring dropdown menu functionality added to facilitate yearly homicide frequency trend analytics.

Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports/ or directly above: "database.csv"

Code for Time Series Plots available above as well.
