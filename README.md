# Homicides-in-America
Interactive Graphics Final Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization | Spring 2018

•	Collaborated as team of 4 to develop a web-based dashboard application in R with Shiny to visualize a Kaggle Inc. dataset of homicide reports 1980-2014 with 600,000+ observations and 24 variables.

•	Applied R’s ggplot2 and Shiny packages to create interactive time series plots (25% of project’s graphics) featuring dropdown menu functionality to facilitate homicide frequency trend analytics.


Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports/ or directly above: homicide_reports.zip

Code for Time Series Plots available above as well in the RMarkdown (.rmd) file.
