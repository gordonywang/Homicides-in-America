# Homicides-in-America
Interactive Graphics Final Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization | Spring 2018

•	Collaborated as team of 4 to develop an interactive dashboard web application with R Shiny as tool to visualize Kaggle dataset of homicide reports 1980-2014 with 600,000+ observations and 24 variables.

•	Applied R’s ggplot2 package to create time series plots (25% of project’s graphics) featuring drop-down menu input controls for dynamic filtering of plot display to facilitate trend analysis.


Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports/ or directly above: homicide_reports.zip

Code for Time Series Plots available above as well in the RMarkdown (.rmd) file.


ui.R contains the our web application's user interface code, which controls how the sidebar menu and interactive parts of each graphic function and display for a user. server.R contains all of the code for the plots and graphics that are to be embedded in the user interface.
